# auction-app
This project is a full-stack auction listing application built using the MERN stack. It features a custom command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing listings directly from the terminal. This was my first time building a CLI tool, and it showcases my ability to integrate backend logic with interactive command-line functionality.
